==================
Manage your tables
==================

Restaurants have very specific needs that shops don’t have. That’s why
Odoo gives restaurant owners several unique features to help them manage
their business in the best possible way.

Floor and table management, bill splitting, or even the possibility to
print the orders in the kitchen, everything is there to help your
business to shine and your employees to work efficiently.

Configuration
=============

To activate the bar/restaurant features, go to :menuselection:`Point of
Sale --> Configuration --> Point of Sale` and open your PoS. Now,
select *Is a Bar/Restaurant*.

Then, new features appear with a fork and a knife on the right, meaning
that the features are restaurant-specific.

Transfer customer(s)

If your customers want to move to another table after they already
ordered, use the transfer button so the order will be moved to the new
table too.

To do so, select the table your customer is currently on.
